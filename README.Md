# XCows
this is the Xscreensaver edition of just cows
## installing
just do make and add the executable as an xscreensaver module bla bla bla you get the point
## extra notes
this only works on x11 (if you have quarter a brain cell you would already know)
and only the image part works, no slideshow fun yet
